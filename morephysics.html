	 1(a) Determine the SI base units of stress. Show your working.[2]
	 
	 <br><br>
	 
	 1(b) A beam is clamped so that the beam is horizontal.A mass of 500g is hung from end Q and the beam bends slightly.
	 <br>
	 The length of the beam from the edge of the clamp R to end Q is 60cm.The width b of the beam is 30mm and the thickness d of the beam is 5mm.The material of the beam has a Youngs modulus E.
	 <br><br>
	 The mass M is made to oscillate vertically.The time period T of the oscillation is 0.58s.
	 <br><br>
	 The period T is given by the expression<br>
	 T=2π√(4Ml³/Ebd³)
	 <br>
	 (i)Determine E in GPa.[3]
	 <br>
	 (ii)The quantities used to determine E should be measured with accuracy and precision
	 <br>
	 1.Explain the difference between accuracy and precision.
	 <br>
	 accuracy_____
	 <br>
	 precision_____[2]
	 <br>
	 2.In a particular experiment the quantities l and T are measured with the same percentage uncertainty.State and explain which of these two quantities contributes more of the uncertainty in the value of E.[1]

	 14(13.5)GPa
	 <br>
1(b)(ii)1.accuracy is determined by the closeness of the value(s) or measurement(s) to the true value
<br>
precision is determined by the range of the values or measurements
<br>
1(b)(ii)2. l is (cubed so) 3 x (percentage/fractional) uncertainty and T is (square so) 2 x (percentage/fractional) and so l contributes more.
