	 1(a) Determine the SI base units of stress. Show your working.
	 
	 <br><br>
	 
	 1(b) A beam is clamped so that the beam is horizontal.A mass of 500g is hung from end Q and the beam bends slightly.
	 <br>
	 The length of the beam from the edge of the clamp R to end Q is 60cm.The width b of the beam is 30mm and the thickness d of the beam is 5mm.The material of the beam has a Youngs modulus E.
	 <br><br>
	 The mass M is made to oscillate vertically.The time period T of the oscillation is 0.58s.
	 <br><br>
	 The period T is given by the expression<br>
	 T=2π√(4Ml³/Ebd³)
	 <br>
	 (i)Determine E in GPa.
	 <br>
	 (ii)The quantities used to determine E should be measured with accuracy and precision
	 <br>
	 1.Explain the difference between accuracy and precision.
	 <br>
	 accuracy_____
	 <br>
	 precision_____
	 <br>
	 2.In a particular experiment the quantities l and T are measured with the same percentage uncertainty.State and explain which of these two quantities contributes more of the uncertainty in the value of E.

	 1(a)stress=force/area or kgms-²/m²
	 <br>
	 =kgm-¹s-²
	 <br>
	 1(b)(i)0.58=2π x [(4x0.5x0.6³)/(E x0.03x0.005³)]^½
	 <br>
	 E=[4π²x4x0.5x0.6³]/[(0.58)²x0.03x(0.005)³]
	 <br>
	 1.35x10^10Pa
	 <br>
	 14(13.5)GPa
	 <br>
1(b)(ii)1.accuracy is determined by the closeness of the value(s) or measurement(s) to the true value
<br>
precision is determined by the range of the values or measurements
<br>
1(b)(ii)2. l is (cubed so) 3 x (percentage/fractional) uncertainty and T is (square so) 2 x (percentage/fractional) and so l contributes more.

	 2(a)A cylinder is made from a material of density 2.7g/cm³.The cylinder has a diameter of 2.4cm and length 5.0cm
	 <br>
	 Show that the cylinder has weight 0.6N
	 <br><br>
	 (b)The cylinder in (a) is hung from the end A of a non-uniform bar AB.The bar has a length of 50cm and has a weight 0.25N.The centre of gravity of the bar is 20cm from B.The bar is pivoted at P.The pivot is 12cm from B.
	 <br>
	 An object X is hung from the end B.The weight of X is adjusted until the bar is horizontal and in equilibrium.
	 <br><br>
	 (i)explain what is meant by the centre of gravity
	 <br><br>
	 (ii)calculate the weight of X
	 <br><br>
	 (c)The cylinder is now immersed in water.An upthrust acts on the cylinder and the bar is not in equilibrium.
	 <br><br>
	 (i)Explain the origin of the upthrust
	 <br><br>
	 (ii)Explain why the weight of X must be reduced inorder to obtain equilibriun for AB
